Using this as the base html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>    
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

Make a webpage with a text input that returns a string reversed, for example "HoLa manola" would return "alonam aLoH".

Create a javascript function for doing the reversal of the string and call it from the html code.

You should show me the code for the html file as well as the code for the script.js file.
